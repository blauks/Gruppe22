				The EPRM is proud to have financed the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM) and RESOLVE to develop the Code of Risk mitigation for ASM engaging in Formal Trade (CRAFT). This code facilitates the relationship between the gold industry and the ASM sector. Artisanal miners produce 20% of the world’s gold, but the complexities of artisanal supply chains often deter refiners and downstream customers who are committed to due diligence and risk management, as there has not been a clear standard for “market acceptability” of artisanal gold. 

				To fill this gap, RESOLVE and the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM) have partnered to develop the Code of Risk mitigation for Artisanal and small scale mining engaged in Formal Trade (CRAFT), a new code of practice that helps miners and their buyers to assess critical social and environmental risks in artisanal supply chains – such as child labor, illicit trade, and uncontrolled use of chemicals – and to track progress in mitigating these and other risks. 

				The code will help miners to understand and demonstrate conformity with the requirements of global markets, therefore improving their access to legal supply chains and better trading conditions. At the same time, companies will benefit from expanded, responsible minerals supply and governments will receive increased revenues as the formal market grows. 

				“For global minerals supply chains, change and market engagement is most critically needed in the places that face the greatest challenges,” said Jennifer Peyser, Director of the Ethical Resource Program at RESOLVE. “CRAFT is innovative as a multi-stakeholder vetted, open source tool to help companies support the economies of artisanal communities, while following good risk management practice and ensuring they are not contributing to illicit trade or human rights abuses.”

				The code has recently undergone a global stakeholder consultation, and CRAFT’s Standard Committee and Advisory Group approved the final version for publication in July. The European Partnership for Responsible Minerals has proudly provided support for the first phase of CRAFT and is excited to continuously support the next phase. 

				“We see CRAFT as one of the cornerstones to drive responsible ASM mining and sourcing,” said Simone Knobloch, COO of Valcambi, a gold refinery. “It is the first industry tool that empowers miners to understand the market sourcing and due diligence requirements, assess their practices and how to address potential gaps, so that they can comply and report conformance with those needs, while providing supply chain actors with the instrument to engage with miners. It will facilitate due diligence by all along the value chain. Using CRAFT schemes, we will be able to support mines improve their practices so they can access global market”.

				Since its launch in 2017 in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, 50 Village Saving and Loans Associations have kicked off activities as part of the Artisanal Mining Women’s Empowerment Credit & Savings project (AFECCOR), funded by the EPRM.

				The project supports women and men in artisanal gold mining communities to access savings and credit in an effort to promote entrepreneurship and economic security. The project is active in Ituri Province, alongside the Just Gold project.

				Economic security
				Over 800 women and 650 men began putting aside money they earn from artisanal gold mining and other activities into group savings in December. Over the past four months, community members have saved almost $20,000 US—money that will go towards new entrepreneurial activities.

				Group members are energized by how much they’ve been able to save in such a short period of time. They have more confidence in their ability to save—and their future economic security.

				Women's leadership
				AFECCOR has a strong focus on promoting women’s leadership and economic empowerment in their homes, at artisanal mine sites, and in the wider community.

				More than 60 percent of the community volunteers that have been trained to support the groups with literacy and financial coaching are women. Additionally, more than 80 percent of the groups have a woman as their president.

				Additional skill building and training is planned for coming months aimed to support women as they begin planning to expand or create new entrepreneurial activities with the microcredit they can receive from their group.

				The gold economy
				The AFECCOR project provides a safe space for all members to save and access credit. At the same time, artisanal miners and community members decrease their reliance on informal credit networks that characterize the “gold economy,” where gold is used as currency for daily transactions, often with unfavorable conditions.

                <p>The European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) has published a new Call for Proposals to support activities that help improve conditions in and around tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) mines and for miners in conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). From 14 August 2018, companies, NGOs, public or semi-public bodies and knowledge institutions can submit their ideas for projects that are linked to the mineral supply chain from CAHRAs.</p>
                <h2>Second Call for Proposals</h2>
                <h3>Focus second Call for Proposals</h3>
                <p>This Call is specifically aimed at improving practices of artisanal and small-scale mines in CAHRAs to produce responsibly and to provide access to markets for these responsibly produced 3TG minerals. For this Call for Proposals, preferred projects will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>create a strong and sustainable link with the supply chain (for example by providing or increasing market access, due diligence and/or traceability); and/or</li>
                    <li>include supply chain actors in the project (upstream, midstream and downstream companies); and/or</li>
                    <li>contribute to gender equality and women’s economic empowerment; and/or</li>
                    <li>have the potential for long-lasting impact in and around mines and mining communities and project scalability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Activities could include promoting acceptable working conditions, promoting fair remuneration, prohibiting child labour and avoiding the use of toxic substances.</p>
                <p>Compared to the previous round of Call for Proposals, this round has no specific geographical focus. Applications must be made by partnerships involving at least one company and partners must provide an own contribution, either cash or in-kind.</p>

                <h2>How to apply?</h2>
                <h3>Who can apply?</h3>
                <p>Grants are intended for partnerships, on behalf of which a lead party applies for the grant. A partnership consists of a minimum of two partners, of which at least one must be a company. Other partners can be NGOs, public or semi-public bodies, or knowledge institutions. The role of lead party can be fulfilled by any of the partners. Applicants can be registered in any country.</p>
                <h3>How to apply?</h3>
                <p>The application process consists of two phases. During the first phase, from 14-08-2018 until 18-10-2018, a quick scan is submitted by your organisation or by the lead party on behalf of your organisation. The quick scan is compulsory before submitting a formal application. The quick scan will be assessed by one of the assigned EPRM advisors, who will make a recommendation on whether or not to develop your ideas further and how to do this. Formats of the quick scan can be downloaded through the link below and, once completed, can be sent to eprm@rvo.nl. While it is required to submit the quick scan and the formal application in English, it is possible to additionally submit documents in French or Spanish when preferred.</p>
                <p>After the quick scan phase, from 18-10-2018 until 22-11-2018, it is possible to submit a formal application including a full proposal. Applications will be ranked based on the total number of points awarded in the assessment of the ranking criteria. The applications that meet the criteria best will be given priority in the award of the grants. The mandatory and explanatory documents can be found under <a href="#">Downloads & links</a>. A more detailed description of the programme and procedures for the second Call for Proposals can be found in the Administrative Rules.</p>
                <h2>The European Partnership for Responsible Minerals</h2>
                <h3>EPRM approach</h3>
                <p>To increase the proportion of minerals produced responsibly and to support socially responsible extraction of minerals that contributes to local development, EPRM undertakes four kinds of activities:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>EPRM will develop and operate a knowledge platform to inform policy and supply chain actors, where participants can share knowledge on due diligence;</li>
                    <li>EPRM will set up activities for SMEs in Europe to increase their awareness of the importance of responsible mineral sourcing and production;</li>
                    <li>EPRM will facilitate connections between upstream, midstream and downstream actors;</li>
                    <li>EPRM will focus on aligning mining intervention strategies and pool and expand resources to support artisanal and small-scale mines to improve their practices, so they produce responsibly and can ultimately access global markets.</li>
                </ol>

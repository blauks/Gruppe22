        <h2><b>Learn</b> about us</h2>
        <p><b>The European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) is a multi-stakeholder partnership aiming to increase the proportion of responsibly-produced minerals from conflict-affected and high risk areas and to support the socially responsible extraction of minerals that contributes to local development.</b></p>

      <div id="aboutUsContent">
        <div id="WhyEPRM"></div>
        <h2><u>Why choose the EPRM</u></h2>
        <p> A number of regions in the world  that are endowed with these minerals, for example Africaâ€™s Great Lakes Region and Colombia, are experiencing prolonged violent conflicts and severe human rights abuses. International trade in minerals can play a significant role in financing and perpetuating human rights violations in these conflict regions. It is therefore imperative to break the link between mineral extraction and conflict.</p>
        <div id="howEPRMWork">
          <h2><u>How does EPRM work?</u></h2>
          <p>Together with other partners, the EPRM will stimulate and increase the demand for responsible 3TG minerals. It will encourage sourcing channels for responsible minerals that will enable suppliers to identify and mitigate risks. Furthermore, the EPRM will motivate supply chain actors and other partners to support mines and local mining communities to improve their practices to produce responsibly and create access to markets.</p>

        <div id="OurObjectives">
        <h2>Our objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>EPRM will develop and operate a knowledge platform to inform policy and supply chain actors and where participants can share knowledge on due diligence;</li>
          <li>EPRM will set up activities for SMEs in Europe to increase their awareness of the importance of responsible mineral sourcing and production;</li>
          <li>EPRM will facilitate connections between upstream, midstream and downstream actors.</li>
          <li>EPRM will focus on aligning mining intervention strategies and pool and expand resources to support artisanal and small-scale mines to improve their practices, so they produce responsibly and can ultimately access global markets.</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="ourPurpose">
      <h2><u>Our purpose</u></h2>
      <p>European Partnership for Responsible Minerals is a multi-stakeholder partnership established with the goal to create better social and economic conditions for mine workers and local mining communities, by increasing the number of mines that adopt responsible mining practices in Conflict and High Risk Areas (CAHRAs).</p>

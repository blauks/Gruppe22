                <h3>If you are an artisanal or small-scale mine and you seek support please read the following highlights below:</h3>
                <p>EPRM is funding projects which are aimed to improve responsible practices of artisanal and small-scale miners in Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs) to produce responsibly and to provide access to markets for these responsibly produced 3TG minerals. </p>
                <p>Please click <a href="./Projects.html">here</a> for an overview of the projects EPRM is funding. </p>
                <p>In the fall of 2018 the EPRM will select new projects through a Call for Proposals. For more information visit <a href="CallsForProposals.html">this page.</a></p>
                <p>The projects EPRM is seeking to grant should be aimed at improving the ability of artisanal and small-scale mines to conduct responsible mining practices, for example by achieving acceptable working conditions, promoting fair remuneration, preventing and/or eliminating child labour, avoiding the use of toxic substances, improving formalisation of artisanal and small-scale mining and addressing violations of human rights, conflict finance, and financial crime.</p>
                <p>EPRM projects are intended for partnerships consisting of a minimum of two partners of which at least one is part of the mineral supply chain. The EPRM highly values inputs and involvement of ASM mines in projects. If you are an ASM mine, the ERPM advices you to connect with local or international NGOs or development agencies to partner with and to jointly define a project idea by submitting a <a href="CallsForProposals.html">quick scan</a> in line with the aims of the current Call for Proposals. The goal of the quick scan is to ultimately receive formal applications that are better tailored to this Call for Proposals. The applicant of the quick scan or the EPRM project officer are both able to request a conversation about the submitted quick scan. In all cases, the quick scan applicant will receive a written advice and recommendation. For more detailed information on the aims and requirements of the Call for Proposals visit <a href="CallsForProposals.html">this page</a> and carefully read <a href="https://europeanpartnership-responsibleminerals.eu/file/download/53241397/Administrative+rules+%28English%29">this document</a>. Please note that the deadline for submitting a quick scan is 18 October 2pm CEST for this round of proposals.  </p>

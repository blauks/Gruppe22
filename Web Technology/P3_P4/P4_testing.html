        <p>The European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) is a multi stakeholder partnership that is aiming to improve the working and social conditions of those involved in the extraction and processing of 3TG minerals. The proposed case is to redesign their current <a href="https://europeanpartnership-responsibleminerals.eu/">website</a> to better communicate relevant information to viewers. Whilst the case is based on a real scenario, EPRM itself is not involved, and the produced deliverables will not be employed by the partnership. Instead, the case has been put forward by a group member, Bram Goosink, who is an ex-employee of the EPRM.</p>

        <p>We start with asking the tester what type of device they are on, and what browser they use. This way we can check how the website works on different types of devices and browsers. Then we ask some questions about who they are so that we can check if any of the testers are in our target demographic. After that we ask about the general design and how it was to navigate the website. We also give the tester two tasks to complete to check if the website intuitive to navigate. We end the google form with feedback questions. </p>

        <h3>Live test: Bjørn</h3>
        <p><b>General info about the subject:</b> 19 years old, student. He used a laptop with google chrome to test the website.</p>
        <p><b>Subjects first time on website</b> It seems like he understands the structure and design of the website, because he could easily find the information he was asked to find and he did not have any questions regarding what each of the pages did. </p>
        <p><b>Feedback from subject:</b> On the homepage, the video takes up too much space and the navbar should stick to the top of your browser before you scroll past the video. The video should also have some kind of indication that there is more content below the video, arrow for example. The navbar should stick to the top of the browser on every page, for ease of navigation. The buttons on the navbar should have a bigger “hitbox” so that it is easier to press them. The background colour could have been something else than white, a light orange or something like that.</p>

        <h3>Live test: Arnhild</h3>
        <p><b>General info about the subject:</b>  in her 50’s, working as a diplomat. She used an Ipad with the default safari browser </p>
        <p><b>Subjects first time on website</b> She expressed that it was clean and easy to navigate. Liked that we put everything in a hierarchy of pages, instead of just presenting many buttons to every page. She easily found what she was looking for when she was quizzed - such as finding the address or a member company.</p>
        <p><b>Feedback from subject:</b>The website struggles a bit on touch devices, as many hover effects are not properly displayed. Furthermore, she did not experience other effects such as the structure infographic fade, or the colours on the ‘get involved pictures’ as she would simply have clicked instead of hovering over. She also found the ‘get involved animation’ a bit noisy, as text from the background was still readable and disturbed the selection screen depending on where you were when you clicked. However the test subject found the website very clean and easy to navigate, despite knowling little about the EPRM, so most of her difficulties arises from the usage of touchscreen as input.</p>
